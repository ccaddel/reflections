What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You receive the output "initialized empty Git repository in 'directory path'". I believe this needs to be done to allow commits to go through to Git, kind of creating a pathway from your local directory, and what from it you want to commit to the empty repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different from the working directory because it can select specific files from the working directory, but the working directory stays the same. It kinda creates a new platform to work on for your commit with select files from the directory.

	The staging area is different from the repository because it kinda "sets the stage" for a "draft" of what will be included in the commit to the repository. So it kinda filters what gets published in the repository.

	The value of the staging area is just what the name implies. You can set the stage and edit from your working directory what you intend to ultimately push through the commit to the repository based on the frame work we discussed earlier about using our discretion for what to include in each commit to a repository.
